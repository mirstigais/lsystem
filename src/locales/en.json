    "about.content": "L-Systems, also known as Lindenmayer systems, were developed by a hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968, while working on modeling plant development. His work was inspired by the need of describing plant growth processes based on formal gramathics, which at the time were only used in computer systems and in learning languages. Lindenmayer noticed that iterative structures could be used to model plant biological development.",
    "about.content2": "The way L-Systems function is to replace the axiom with what's defined in the rules, for example, if the initial state is F and the rule is F = FF, then upon each iteration letter F will be replaced with FF. After execution, the resulting string will represent drawing operation.",
    "about.content3": "To visualize systems, a drawing method called “Turtle graphics” is often used, in which when a move from one coordinate to another is made, a line is drawn. This drawing method has 2 states - move while drawing and move.",
